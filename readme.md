*AlBhedify* is an iOS app that translates between the fictional language Al Bhed and English. It was mostly written as an experiment in Swift and iOS development, and should by no means be taken seriously.

For more information on the language, see the [Final Fantasy wiki](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Al_Bhed#Language).
