<p><i>Al Bhed</i> is a constructed language appearing in the game <i>Final Fantasy X</i>. Rather than a complete language, it is a substrtution cipher based on English.</p>

<p><i>AlBhedify</i> is an app for translating Al Bhed to and from English. It is just a small development experiment, and should not be taken very seriously. ;)</p>
